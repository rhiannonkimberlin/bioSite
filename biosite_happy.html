<p class="bio">Hazzel had a huge falling out with her family in 2014 when she came out to them as being a lesbian. Her family was torn, and her parents threatened to not let her around her brothers anymore. Hazzel is extremely family oriented, so she suppressed her feelings and preferences to ensure she could keep her family together. In 2019, Hazzel began talking to Juma, who was a DJ at the clubs she liked to visit. They kept their relationship a secret for 7 months, which was difficult on her because she always felt like she was lying to her parents. It had gotten to the point that Hazzel moved out of her childhood home to avoid confrontation with her parents. In February 2020, Hazzel asked her parents out to lunch, where she finally admitted she couldn't change who she was, <i>no matter how hard she had tried for them</i>. They accepted her openly in 2020 and Hazzel has never been more relieved in her enitre life. She now has a caring girlfriend, a supportive family, and is practically a step mother to two great kids. It's her biggest accomplishment.</p>
