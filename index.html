<p class="bio">Hazzel Munoz has a large heart with a big attitude. As a Gemini, she embodies the role of 'work hard, play hard'. She graduated from NAU with a Bachelor’s in Special Education. Monday through Friday you will catch her at her job in finances for nine to ten hours a day, doing the job she has loved for eight years. On weekends however, a whole new animal comes out. She goes out and loves to have fun, and as her friends claim, poison them. In fact, a new term has become a popular sensation amongst her friends called, ‘getting Hazzeled’, which just means she could hold her liquor better than they could. Despite spending time with her loving girlfriend Juma and her kids, she still has a passion to braid hair and do make up. Though she is self-taught she has incredible style and is always pushing boundaries on different looks and styles. She hopes to follow this passion in conjunction with her job, and is always looking for new models.</p>
